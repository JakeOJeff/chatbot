# Emotional Chatbot Interface in LÃ–VE2D

This is a visually expressive chatbot built using [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/). The bot responds to different emotional tones and input cues, simulates a natural typing delay, and displays dynamic animations like flying letters and slash effects for user input.

## ðŸ§  Features

- **Emotional NLP**: Detects emotion-based keywords like _sadness_, _hope_, _insults_, etc., and replies accordingly.
- **Typing Simulation**: Shows `.` â†’ `..` â†’ `...` typing states before the bot replies.
- **Dynamic Animations**:
  - Letters fly upward when typing.
  - Slash lines appear on backspace.
- **Modes**: Switches between `listen` and `vent` mode depending on context.
- **Personalization**: Responds differently if a name is detected.
- **Profile UI**: Includes a customizable chat header with name and profile image.


## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- **LÃ–VE 11.x** or later
- All modules are Lua files and should be placed under a `phrasal/` directory.
